##### AB_Testing_Project
##### Comparing bidding transform with AB Testing

##### Business Problem :
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, 'average bidding', as an alternative to the existing bidding type called 'maximum bidding'.\
An A/B test is required to test this new feature and to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding.\
In this task, the results of the A/B test are expected to be analyzed. \
The ultimate success criterion is Purchase. Therefore, the focus is on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.

##### Dataset Story:
In this data set, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here.\
There are two separate data sets, the control and test groups. These datasets are on separate pages of ab_testing.xlsxexcel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and AverageBidding was applied to the test group.
